## üìã Project Overview

This project analyzes customer behavior patterns to determine the likelihood of coupon acceptance when delivered to drivers via mobile devices. Using  visualizations, probability distributions and statistical analysis, we identify key factors that influence acceptance decisions and provide actionable insights for targeted marketing campaigns.

## What is the problem

**Question:** What factors determine whether a driver will accept a coupon delivered to their mobile device?

**Context:** Imagine driving through town when a coupon is delivered to your phone for a nearby restaurant. Will you accept it and make a detour? The decision depends on multiple factors including demographics, social context, timing, weather, and personal preferences.

## What is the data

- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository (Amazon Mechanical Turk Survey)
- **Size:** 12,684 records with 26 features
- **Target Variable:** Y (1 = Accept, 0 = Reject)
- **Overall Acceptance Rate:** 56.8%

### Coupon Types Analyzed:
- üçï **Carry out & Take away** (73.5% acceptance - highest)
- üçΩÔ∏è **Restaurant (<$20)** (70.7% acceptance)
- ‚òï **Coffee House** (49.9% acceptance)
- üçΩÔ∏è **Restaurant ($20-50)** (44.1% acceptance)
- üç∫ **Bar** (41.0% acceptance - lowest)
  
## What are the findings

### üü¢ High Acceptance Customers (70-85% acceptance)
- **Demographics:** Young adults (under 30)
- **Social Context:** With friends or partners
- **Timing:** Afternoon hours (2PM optimal)
- **Preferences:** Convenience-focused (takeaway, quick service)

### üî¥ Low Acceptance Customers (25-40% acceptance)
- **Demographics:** Older customers (50+)
- **Social Context:** Often alone
- **Timing:** Early morning or late evening
- **Preferences:** Routine-oriented, planned purchases

### üéØ **Best Predictive Factors**

1. **Coupon Type**: Carry out & Take away coupons have the highest acceptance rate (73.5%)
2. **Timing**: 2PM is the optimal time for coupon delivery (66.2% acceptance)
3. **Demographics**: Customers under 21 show highest acceptance (63.4%)
4. **Social Context**: Customers with friends are most likely to accept (67.3%)
5. **Weather**: Sunny weather conditions favor acceptance (59.5%)

### üìà **Prediction Model Recommendations**

**High-Probability Acceptance Profile:**
- **Target**: Young adults (below 21) with friends
- **Timing**: Afternoon hours (2PM)
- **Coupon Type**: Carry out & Take away offers
- **Weather**: Sunny days
- **Expected Success Rate**: 70-80%

**Medium-Probability Acceptance Profile:**
- **Target**: 21-30 age group, any passenger type
- **Timing**: 10AM or 6PM
- **Coupon Type**: Restaurant (<$20) offers
- **Weather**: Any weather condition
- **Expected Success Rate**: 50-65%
